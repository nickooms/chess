### AGIV - KLIPDF Viewer Prototype

https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/help/klip

The PMKL (Presentation Model Cables and Pipes) working group of the Flemish Agency for Geographical Information needed a prototype of an application (KLIPDF Viewer Prototype) to display different layers containing cables and pipes on top of a map of Belgium.
I decided to extend Open Source JavaScript Frameworks OpenLayers and Node.js used in an SPA (Single Page Application) to provide functionality for layering UI controls on top of OpenLayers with WebGL (Open GL in a browser) rendering support.
MongoDB was used for initial data loading
The PMKL working group was able to use the KLIPDF Viewer Prototype in meetings with the
largest utility network (Gas, Water, Electricity and Sewage) providers in Belgium:
Direct visualization of IMKL (utility network element) data from GML data sources.(SOAP Web
Services)
Pre-processing of source Shape data to GML for consumption via OGC WFS with OpenLayers as
client.
Converted all icons for various objects displayed on the map to SVG so the icons are clear qnd
crisp at every resolution and zoom level.
Achieved visibility and styling variations depending on object type and zoom level:
Initial data coming from partners was loaded in MongoDB
Data transformation was done using Node.js on MongoDB

### Itineris Eneco Billing

https://www.itineris.net/global/solutionforutilities/

Itineris needed a service to convert data in their new Microsoft Dynamics Nav 2012 based software to the format of the previous implementation based on Microsoft Dynamics Nav 2009 to be able to use the existing Microsoft Word template.

- After compairing the old and new XML data structures I implemented the service as an XSLT transformation executed in a .NET C# SOAP Web Service using Unit Testing in a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach.
- Existing Word templates could be used with the new platform
